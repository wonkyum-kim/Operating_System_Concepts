The main difference between preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling is that in preemptive scheduling, the CPU can be taken away from a process before it has completed its execution, while in nonpreemptive scheduling, the CPU is not taken away from a process until it has completed its execution or it enters into a waiting state. Preemptive scheduling is more flexible and allows for better response time, but it also incurs a higher overhead due to frequent context switching. Nonpreemptive scheduling is simpler and more predictable, but it can result in longer response times and can lead to resource utilization problems if a process monopolizes the CPU.
