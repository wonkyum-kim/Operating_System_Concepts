# 6.1

Disabling interrupts frequently can affect the system's clock in several ways.

Firstly, when interrupts are disabled, the processor cannot respond to external events, including clock ticks. This can cause the system clock to drift or lose accuracy, as the clock will not be updated as frequently as it should be.

Secondly, disabling interrupts can also affect the accuracy of time-sensitive operations, such as measuring the duration of a task or scheduling time-based events. Without accurate timing information, these operations may not function correctly.

To minimize the effects of disabling interrupts on the system clock, it is important to keep the time that interrupts are disabled as short as possible. This can be done by limiting the use of critical sections of code that require interrupts to be disabled and by optimizing code to reduce the time that interrupts are disabled.

Another approach to minimizing the effects of disabling interrupts is to use hardware timers or other devices that are not affected by interrupt disabling. These devices can be used to provide accurate timing information and to trigger time-sensitive operations, even when interrupts are disabled.
