The purpose of system calls is to provide an interface between a running program (user space) and the operating system (kernel space). 

# 2.2

The purpose of the command interperter is to interpret and execute commands entered by users and facilitate the interaction between users and the operating system.

By separating the command interpreter from the kernel, the operating system achieves a modular and flexible design, promotes security and stability, supports multi-user environments, and allows users to customize their command-line experience according to their preferences and needs.

# 2.3

Three system calls (fork(), exec(), and wait()) form the core sequence used by a command interpreter or shell to start a new process on a UNIX system. 

# 2.4

The purpose of system programs is to provide a convenient environment for program development and execution.

# 2.5

The main advantage of the layered approach is simplicity of construction and debugging. 

However, layered approach may introduce performance overhead, rigidity, duplication of functionality, and challenges in defining layer boundaries
